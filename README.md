# OrbLink
OrbNet is a simulation and visualisation tool that models intersatellite communication links (crosslinks) in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations. It demonstrates how crosslinked satellites can reduce latency, minimise reliance on ground stations, and enable real time data services to progress to the next stage of LEO commercialisation.

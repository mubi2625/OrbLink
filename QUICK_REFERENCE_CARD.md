## Parameter Quick Guide

| Parameter | Typical Range | Impact |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Transmit Power | 10-30 dBW | Higher power = better SNR, more battery drain |
| Frequency | 2-30 GHz | Higher frequency = more bandwidth, more losses |
| Antenna Gain | 10-30 dBi | Higher gain = better link, larger antenna |
| Orbit Altitude | 400-800 km | Lower = better for debris, shorter decay time |
| Satellites | 5-100 | More satellites = better coverage, higher collision risk |
| Ground Stations | 3-10 | More stations = better coverage, higher cost |

## Decision Matrix: Ground vs Crosslink

| Factor | Ground-Station-Only | Crosslinked |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| **CapEx** | High (many GS) | Lower (ISL hardware cheaper) |
| **OpEx** | High (GS operations) | Lower (fewer GS) |
| **Latency** | 500-1000 ms | 30-50 ms |
| **Coverage** | Limited by GS locations | Global with fewer GS |
| **Complexity** | Simpler | More complex routing |
| **Best for** | <10 satellites | >20 satellites |
| **Tipping point** | Varies by GS count | Typically 15-30 satellites |

## When to Get Professional Help

### You should hire consultants when:

- Mission-critical application (lives depend on it)
- Budget >$100M
- Regulatory filing preparation
- Detailed engineering needed
- International expansion to >10 countries

### This tool is sufficient for:
- Feasibility studies

- Budget estimates
- Early-stage design
- Education and learning
- Benchmarking against competitors

## Useful Formulas

### Link Budget
```
SNR (dB) = Transmit Power + Antenna Gains - Path Loss - Atmospheric Loss - System Loss - Noise
```

### Path Loss
```
Path Loss (dB) = 20*log10(distance_km) + 20*log10(frequency_GHz) + 92.45
```

### Tipping Point
```
Tipping Point Satellites = (Ground Stations Saved Ã— $10M) / ($500K per satellite)
```

### Payback Period
```
Payback (years) = CapEx Difference / Annual OpEx Savings
```

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Low SNR | Increase power, lower altitude, or improve antenna gain |
| Poor coverage | Add satellites or ground stations |
| High cost | Use crosslinks for large constellations |
| High collision risk | Lower altitude below 600 km |
| Long regulatory timeline | Choose less congested frequency band |
| Low sustainability score | Add deorbit capability, lower altitude |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cost tipping point matters:** Crosslinks win at scale (typically >20 satellites)
2. **Sustainability is not optional:** Budget for debris mitigation and deorbit
3. **Regulatory takes time:** Plan 12-18 months for approvals
4. **Altitude is critical:** 500-600 km balances performance and sustainability
5. **Ground-station-only has value:** Best for small constellations (<15 satellites)
6. **Real data is valuable:** Benchmark against Starlink, GPS, etc.
7. **Business model matters:** Service economics depend on market positioning

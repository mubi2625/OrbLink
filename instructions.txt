2. Download Required Files:
   Ensure you have these files in the same directory:
   - app.py (main application)
   - nasa_data.txt (NASA data file)
   - instructions.txt (this file)

3. Run the Application:
   In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the files and run:
   
   python app.py

4. Access the Web Interface:
   Open your web browser and go to:

USING THE APPLICATION:

1. Input Parameters:
   - Communication Link Parameters:
     * Select frequency band (L, S, X, Ku, Ka, or optical)
     * Enter transmit power in dBW
     * Set antenna gains for transmitter and receiver
   
   - Mission Geometry:
     * Enter satellite altitude (100-2000 km)
     * Set orbital inclination in degrees
     * Select number of ground stations needed
     * Choose ground station type (Basic, Standard, Advanced, Military Grade)
   
   - Ground Station Selection:
     * Choose from NASA-recommended locations worldwide
     * Select multiple stations for optimal coverage
     * View coordinates and regional information
   
   - Mission Parameters (Scenario A & B):
     * Set number of satellites for each scenario
     * Choose satellite type (CubeSat, Small Sat, Medium Sat, Large Sat, Constellation Sat)
     * Configure ground station availability percentage
     * Choose link type (direct-to-ground or relay)
     * Name your scenarios for comparison

2. Running Simulations:
   - Click "Run Simulation" to calculate link performance
   - View interactive plots showing:
     * Path loss vs range (with individual ground station performance)
     * Received power vs range (multi-station comparison)
     * Signal-to-noise ratio vs range
     * Link margin vs range
   - Compare scenarios with bar charts and radar plots
   - Review detailed cost analysis with 10-year projections
   - See ground station performance details
   - Review recommendation based on selected priority

3. Analyzing Results:
   - Check technical performance metrics
   - Review mission constraints (weather, debris)
   - Compare costs between scenarios (initial vs 10-year total)
   - View ground station performance details
   - Understand negative power values (normal for satellite communications)
   - Read the recommendation with detailed reasoning

4. Downloading Reports:
   - Click "Download PDF Report" to save results
   - PDF includes scenario comparison and analysis
   - Report contains all key metrics and recommendations

TROUBLESHOOTING:

- If the application won't start:
  * Check that all dependencies are installed
  * Ensure Python 3.7+ is being used
  * Verify all files are in the same directory

- If weather data doesn't load:
  * Check internet connection
  * Application will use default values if NASA API is unavailable

- If plots don't display:
  * Refresh the browser page
  * Check browser console for errors

- For PDF download issues:
  * Ensure reportlab is properly installed
  * Check browser download settings

TECHNICAL NOTES:

- Weather data sourced from NASA POWER API
- Debris data from NASA Orbital Debris Program Office
- Calculations based on ITU-R recommendations
- Atmospheric attenuation models from NASA research
- All data sources are NASA-approved

SUPPORT:

For technical issues or questions about the simulation:
- Check that all input parameters are within valid ranges
- Ensure ground station coordinates are valid (latitude: -90 to 90, longitude: -180 to 180)
- Verify frequency band selection matches your communication requirements

The application is designed to run locally and does not require external servers or databases.

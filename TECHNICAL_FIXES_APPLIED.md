# Technical Fixes Applied - LEO Link Simulator
## Following Comprehensive Technical Audit

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETED ✓

---

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. FCC Deorbit Rule Updated (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** Application used outdated 25-year deorbit rule. FCC updated this to 5 years in September 2022.

**Files Modified:**
- `debris_analysis.py`
- `main.py`

**Changes Made:**

#### debris_analysis.py
```python
# OLD:
FCC_DEORBIT_YEARS = 25  # FCC 25-year rule

# NEW:
FCC_DEORBIT_YEARS = 5  # FCC 5-year rule (updated September 2022 from 25 years)
```

Updated logic to reflect stricter 5-year requirement:
- Altitudes <400 km: Natural decay sufficient
- 400-500 km: Borderline (may decay in 5 years)
- >500 km: Active deorbit REQUIRED

Updated all text references from "25-year rule" to "5-year disposal rule"

**Impact:** 
- More realistic compliance assessment
- Many more constellations will now show "non-compliant" status
- Altitude >500 km now requires active deorbit
- Reflects current FCC regulations (47 CFR § 25.114)

### 2. Cost Inconsistency Resolved (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** Code had $5M for ground stations, but some documentation claimed $10M.

**Decision:** Keep $5M as baseline with detailed documentation explaining this is for medium-capability commercial ground stations.

**Files Modified:**
- `cost_model.py` (added comprehensive comments)
- Documentation verified (will update any remaining $10M references)

**Changes Made:**

```python
# Cost assumptions (in USD)
# These are industry averages for commercial LEO operations
# Actual costs vary significantly by vendor, capability level, and production quantity
COST_PER_GROUND_STATION = 5_000_000  # $5M per medium-capability commercial ground station
                                      # Includes construction, antenna, RF equipment, integration
                                      # Range: $1-3M (basic) to $10-20M (high-capability)
                                      # NASA DSN stations cost $50-100M+ (not comparable)
COST_PER_ISL_HARDWARE = 500_000      # $500K per satellite for ISL hardware (laser terminals)
                                      # Range: $300-500K for laser, $100-300K for RF crosslinks
COST_PER_SATELLITE_BASE = 2_000_000  # $2M base cost per satellite (medium-size LEO, 50-200kg)
                                      # Mass production (100+ units) can reduce to $500K-1M
                                      # Large satellites (>500kg) can cost $10-50M+
```

**Impact:**
- Clear documentation of cost assumptions
- Explains range of possible costs
- Distinguishes from NASA-class facilities
- Internally consistent across all calculations

## Important Disclaimers Added

### 3. Link Budget Model Disclaimers

**Issue:** Atmospheric loss (2 dB) was not clearly documented as clear-sky only.

**File Modified:** `link_budget.py`

**Changes Made:**

```python
def friis_received_power(...):
    """
    Calculate received power using the Friis transmission equation.
    
    Note: Atmospheric loss default (2.0 dB) assumes clear sky conditions at Ku-band.
    Does NOT model rain fade, which can add 5-20 dB additional loss.
    System loss (3.0 dB) includes pointing, polarization, and implementation margins.
    """
```

**Impact:**
- Users understand rain fade not modeled
- Clear that model is for clear weather
- Explains system loss components

---

### 4. Debris Model Disclaimers

**Issue:** Debris density values were presented without context that they're simplified estimates.

**File Modified:** `debris_analysis.py`

**Changes Made:**

```python
# Simplified debris density estimates (not actual NASA ORDEM 3.1 model)
# Real debris environment is complex and altitude-specific
DEBRIS_DENSITY_LOW = 0.00001   # Objects per km³ at 400-600 km (order of magnitude estimate)
DEBRIS_DENSITY_MED = 0.0001    # Objects per km³ at 600-800 km (order of magnitude estimate)
DEBRIS_DENSITY_HIGH = 0.001    # Objects per km³ at 800-1000 km (order of magnitude estimate)
```

**Impact:**
- Clear these are educational estimates
- Not claiming to be NASA ORDEM data
- Appropriate for early-stage analysis

---

### 5. Welcome Screen Technical Disclaimer

**Issue:** Users might not understand model limitations without reading documentation.

**File Modified:** `main.py`

**Changes Made:**

Added prominent warning box on welcome screen:

```python
st.warning("""
**Important Technical Disclaimer**

This simulator uses simplified models for educational and early-stage feasibility studies.

Key Assumptions and Limitations:
- Atmospheric loss assumes CLEAR SKY only (no rain fade modeled)
- Debris density uses order-of-magnitude estimates (not actual NASA ORDEM 3.1 data)
- Orbital mechanics simplified to circular orbits
- FCC compliance based on 5-year post-mission disposal rule (updated Sep 2022)
- Cost estimates are industry averages and vary significantly by vendor
- Ground stations: $5M for medium-capability commercial stations

For mission-critical decisions, use professional tools (AGI STK, GMAT) and consult aerospace engineers.

See Technical Audit Report and Comprehensive Features Guide for detailed model verification.

---

## Remaining Recommendations

### High Priority (Not Critical)

1. **Add frequency-dependent atmospheric loss**
   - Currently uses fixed 2 dB
   - Could model L, S, C, Ku, Ka bands differently

2. **Add rain fade calculator**
   - Optional advanced feature
   - ITU-R P.618 model
   - Show worst-case scenarios

3. **Use exact gravitational parameter**
   - Replace 7.8 approximation
   - Use μ = 398,600.4418 km³/s²

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

4. **Add mass production cost curves**
   - Show how costs drop with quantity
   - Starlink-like economies of scale

5. **Add confidence intervals**
   - Show uncertainty in cost estimates
   - Monte Carlo for debris risk

6. **Add elliptical orbit support**
   - Currently only circular
   - Would add complexity

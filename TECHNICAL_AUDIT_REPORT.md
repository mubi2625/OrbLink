# Technical Audit Report - LEO Link Simulator
## Comprehensive Verification Against NASA Data and Industry Standards

**Audit Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Auditor:** Development Team  
**Purpose:** Verify all technical data for consistency and accuracy

---

## CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Cost Inconsistency

### Issue #1: Ground Station Cost Mismatch

**Problem:** Documentation claims $10M per ground station, but code has $5M.

**Locations:**
- **Code (cost_model.py line 6):** `COST_PER_GROUND_STATION = 5_000_000`
- **Documentation:** Multiple files claim $10M (README.md, WHATS_NEW.md, ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md, QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md)

**Impact:** All cost calculations, tipping point analysis, and recommendations are affected.

**Resolution Required:** Choose one value and update consistently everywhere.

## Cost Model Verification

### Ground Station Costs

**Industry Research:**
- Small LEO ground station (basic): $1-3M
- Medium capability ground station: $5-10M
- High-capability ground station: $10-20M
- NASA DSN station: $50-100M+

**Sources:**
- Commercial satellite operators (SpaceX, Planet Labs)
- AWS Ground Station pricing (lower end)
- Traditional aerospace ground stations (higher end)

**Recommendation:** Use $5M as baseline for medium-capability commercial ground station.

**Rationale:**
- Typical for commercial LEO operations
- Includes construction, antenna, RF equipment, and integration
- Does NOT include premium NASA-level capabilities
- Conservative but realistic for new operators

**Required Changes:**
1. Remove all "$10M" references in documentation
2. Keep `COST_PER_GROUND_STATION = 5_000_000` in code
3. Add clear note that this is for medium-capability commercial stations
4. Document that NASA DSN stations cost 10-20x more

## Link Budget Verification

### Physical Constants

**Current Values:**
```python
BOLTZMANN_CONSTANT = 1.380649e-23  # J/K
SPEED_OF_LIGHT = 299792458  # m/s
```

**NASA Reference:** 
- Boltzmann constant: 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K (2019 SI redefinition)
- Speed of light: 299,792,458 m/s (exact by definition)

**Status:** ✓ VERIFIED - Exact values per SI standards

### Atmospheric Loss

**Current Value:** 2.0 dB default

**Verification:**
- Clear sky LEO at 10 GHz: 0.5-1 dB
- Clear sky LEO at 20 GHz: 1-2 dB
- Light rain at 10 GHz: 2-5 dB
- Moderate rain at 20 GHz: 5-15 dB

**Sources:**
- ITU-R P.618 (rain attenuation model)
- NASA SCaN link budget guidelines
- SpaceX Starlink link budget (public presentations)

**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- 2 dB is reasonable for clear sky at Ku-band (12-18 GHz)
- Should document frequency-dependent nature
- Should note rain fade is NOT modeled

**Required Change:** Add note that this is clear-sky only

**Verification:**
- Pointing loss: 0.5-1 dB
- Polarization mismatch: 0.3-0.5 dB

## Debris Model Verification

### FCC 25-Year Rule

**Current Value:** 25 years

**NASA/FCC Reference:** 
- FCC Rules 47 CFR § 25.114(d)(4)
- "Operators must ensure disposal within 5 years post-mission (LEO)"
- Previously 25 years, updated to 5 years in September 2022

**Status:** ⚠️ OUTDATED - FCC updated rule to 5 years in 2022

**Required Change:** Update FCC_DEORBIT_YEARS from 25 to 5

### Debris Density Values

**Current Values:**
```python
DEBRIS_DENSITY_LOW = 0.00001   # Objects per km³ at 400-600 km
DEBRIS_DENSITY_MED = 0.0001    # Objects per km³ at 600-800 km
DEBRIS_DENSITY_HIGH = 0.001    # Objects per km³ at 800-1000 km
```

**NASA ODPO Data:**
- LEO debris density is highly variable by altitude
- Peaks around 800-1000 km (sun-synchronous orbits)
- Lower at 400-500 km due to atmospheric drag removal

**Status:** ⚠️ ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ESTIMATES
- Actual NASA ODPO models are complex (ORDEM 3.1)
- These are simplified educational estimates
- Real debris tracking uses object catalogs

**Required Change:** Add disclaimer that these are simplified estimates, not NASA ORDEM data

### Orbital Velocity Calculation

**Current Formula:**
```python
orbital_velocity = 7.8 * np.sqrt(earth_radius / orbit_radius)  # km/s
```

**Correct Formula:**
```
v = sqrt(μ / r)
where μ = 398600.4418 km³/s² (Earth's gravitational parameter)
```

**Status:** ✓ APPROXIMATELY CORRECT
- 7.8 km/s is close to sqrt(398600 / 6371) ≈ 7.91 km/s at surface
- The scaling is correct for orbital mechanics

**Note:** Could use exact μ value for better accuracy

### Deorbit Delta-v

**Current Formula:**
```python
delta_v_ms = 50 + altitude_drop * 0.5  # m/s
```

**Verification:**
- To lower perigee from 600 km to 200 km: ~150-200 m/s
- Formula gives: 50 + (400 * 0.5) = 250 m/s

**Status:** ⚠️ SIMPLIFIED
- Close to correct order of magnitude
- Real calculation requires Hohmann transfer equations
- Ignores atmospheric drag assist

**Recommendation:** Add note that this is simplified estimate

**Formula:**
```python

**Current Value:** 50 ms additional delay

**Verification:**
- Bent-pipe processing: 10-20 ms
- Routing and switching: 5-10 ms
- Protocol overhead: 10-30 ms
- Ground network latency: 20-50 ms

**Total:** 45-110 ms

**Status:** ✓ VERIFIED - Conservative mid-range estimate

### Crosslink Processing

**Current Value:** 5 ms

**Verification:**
- Onboard switching: 1-5 ms
- Laser acquisition (already established): <1 ms
- Protocol overhead: 2-10 ms

**Status:** ✓ VERIFIED - Optimistic but achievable

**Note:** Add disclaimer that this assumes pre-established links

## Conclusion

The LEO Link Simulator has generally sound technical models with TWO CRITICAL ISSUES:

1. **Ground station cost inconsistency** between code ($5M) and documentation ($10M)
2. **Outdated FCC deorbit rule** (25 years vs current 5 years)

All other technical parameters are verified as reasonable estimates or approximations. The models are appropriate for:
- Educational purposes ✓
- Early-stage feasibility studies ✓
- Architecture trade-off analysis ✓

The models are NOT suitable for:
- Mission-critical engineering ✗
- Regulatory filings ✗
- Detailed systems design ✗

**Overall Assessment:** PASS with required fixes

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix critical issues immediately
2. Add disclaimers for simplified models
3. Document all assumptions clearly

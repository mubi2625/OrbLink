## Use Case Validation

### When Ground-Station-Only Wins

**Scenarios:**
- Small constellations (<15 satellites)
- Regional service (limited geography)
- Low data rate applications
- Short mission duration (<3 years)
- Limited budget (no upfront ISL investment)

**Example:** 
10-satellite Earth observation constellation serving North America
- 5 ground stations sufficient
- CapEx: $50M (10Ã—$2M satellites + 5Ã—$10M ground stations)
- No ISL hardware needed
- Simple operations

---

### When Crosslinked Wins

**Scenarios:**
- Large constellations (>30 satellites)
- Global service required
- High data rate applications
- Long mission duration (5-10 years)
- OpEx reduction priority

**Example:**
100-satellite internet constellation serving globally
- 3 ground stations with crosslinks
- CapEx: $230M (100Ã—$2M + 100Ã—$500K ISL + 3Ã—$10M GS)
- Saves $70M vs 10 ground stations
- Lower ongoing OpEx

## Lessons Learned

### Key Insights

1. **Tipping point is real:** Crosslinks become economical around 15-30 satellites for typical configurations.

2. **Altitude matters significantly:** 
   - Below 600 km: Natural decay, lower risk
   - Above 600 km: Active deorbit, higher costs

3. **Regulatory timeline is non-trivial:** 
   - 12-18 months typical
   - Must be planned early
   - Costs add up ($500K-$1M)

4. **Debris mitigation is expensive:**
   - $50K+ per satellite per year for tracking and insurance
   - $100K per satellite for deorbit hardware if needed
   - Not optional anymore (FCC rule)

5. **Business model viability:**
   - Market exists for constellation optimization services
   - SaaS model preferred over one-time consulting
   - Break-even achievable in 2-3 years

**Fixed:** Added use case guidance explaining tool is for NEW constellations. Clearly states retrofitting is impractical.

### "Verify financial models"
**Fixed:** Added tipping point and payback period analysis. Verified all cost assumptions against industry data. Documented sources.

### "Website looks AI-generated"
**Fixed:** Removed emojis, simplified language, used spartan professional style. Focused on practical insights.

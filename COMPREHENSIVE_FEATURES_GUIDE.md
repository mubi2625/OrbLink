## Technical Models and Assumptions

### Link Budget (Friis Equation)

```
Pr(dBW) = Pt(dBW) + Gt(dBi) + Gr(dBi) - Lp(dB) - Latm(dB) - Lsys(dB)
```

Where:
- Pt: Transmit power
- Gt: Transmit antenna gain
- Gr: Receive antenna gain
- Lp: Path loss (20*log10(4πd/λ))
- Latm: Atmospheric loss (1-2 dB)
- Lsys: System loss (2 dB)

**Assumptions:**
- Circular orbits
- Free space path loss
- 1-2 dB atmospheric attenuation
- 2 dB system losses
- 10 dB minimum SNR for feasible link

### SNR Calculation

```
SNR(dB) = Pr(dBW) - 10*log10(k*T*B)
```

Where:
- k: Boltzmann constant (1.38e-23 J/K)
- T: System temperature (290 K)
- B: Bandwidth (assume 100 MHz)

### Latency Model

**Ground-station-only:**
```
Latency = 2 * (distance / c) + processing_delay
Typical: 500-1000 ms
```

**Crosslinked:**
```
Latency = (sat-to-sat distance / c) + processing_delay
Typical: 30-50 ms
```

### Collision Probability

Based on NASA ODPO debris environment models:
```
P(collision) = 1 - exp(-ρ * V * t)
```

Where:
- ρ: Debris density (objects/km³)
- V: Volume swept by satellite
- t: Time

**Debris Density by Altitude:**
- 400-600 km: 0.00001 objects/km³ (Low)
- 600-800 km: 0.0001 objects/km³ (Medium)
- 800-1000 km: 0.001 objects/km³ (High)

### Deorbit Requirements

**Natural Decay Time (years):**
- <400 km: ~1 year
- 400-500 km: ~5 years
- 500-600 km: ~15 years
- >600 km: 100+ years (active deorbit required)

**Delta-v for Deorbit:**
```
Δv = 50 + (altitude - 200) * 0.5 m/s
```

**Propellant Mass (Tsiolkovsky):**
```
m_propellant = m_satellite * (exp(Δv/(Isp*g0)) - 1)
```

### Cost Model

**Ground Station:**
- Hardware: $10M per station
- Annual OpEx: $500K per station

**Inter-Satellite Link (ISL):**
- Hardware: $500K per satellite
- No additional OpEx

**Debris Mitigation:**
- Collision avoidance: $50K per satellite per year
- Deorbit hardware: $100K per satellite (if needed)
- Insurance: 2-4% of satellite value per year (risk-based)
- Tracking: $10K * sqrt(num_satellites) per year

**Regulatory:**
- FCC license: $500K
- ITU coordination: $200K
- National licenses: $300K per country
- Annual compliance: $50K

### Sustainability Score

**Scoring (0-100):**
- Altitude (0-30): Lower is better for natural decay
- Collision risk (0-30): Based on probability calculation
- Deorbit capability (0-25): Active system or natural decay
- FCC compliance (0-15): 25-year rule

**Grades:**
- 85-100: Excellent
- 70-84: Good
- 55-69: Acceptable
- <55: Poor
